# Convolution Accelerator VLSI
Optional Project for the course VLSI in the 8th semester of University. The purpose behind it was to build a project in system verilog that applies a convolution of a specific filter to an image. Currently only positive (all the numbers of the filter) filters are supported. There are two versions, one without pipeline and one with.
